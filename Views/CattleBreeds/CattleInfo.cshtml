                <h4>About:</h4>
                <p>
                    The Kangeyam is one of Tamil Nadu’s most iconic indigenous draught cattle breeds, widely admired
                    for its exceptional hardiness, muscular strength, and natural ability to perform in dry,
                    semi-arid landscapes.
                    Originating from the Kangeyam region of Kongu Nadu, this breed has been closely associated with
                    the agricultural traditions of the communities in and around Tiruppur, Erode, Dharapuram, and
                    Perundurai for centuries.
                    Kangeyam cattle possess a compact and sturdy frame, a clean grey coat that may range from
                    silver-grey to dark steel grey, a well-developed hump, and strong, outward-curving horns that
                    give the breed its unmistakable appearance.
                    They are highly valued by farmers because they can work long hours in harsh climates with
                    minimal feed, making them exceptionally reliable for ploughing, carting, and all forms of
                    traditional field work.
                    Beyond agriculture, Kangeyam bulls also play a prominent role in Jallikattu, where their
                    agility, alertness, and powerful physique make them popular among trainers and competitors.
                    Known for their calm temperament yet spirited energy during work or sport, Kangeyam cattle
                    symbolize the resilience, cultural identity, and rural pride of Tamil Nadu. Despite
                    modernization and the decline of draught animals in farming,
                    dedicated breeders and conservation groups continue to preserve this remarkable breed,
                    recognizing its importance to local heritage and sustainable agriculture.
